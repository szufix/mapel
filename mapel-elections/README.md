# Mapel-elections
This pacakge is a plugin for [mapel](https://pypi.org/project/mapel/) extending
it with capabilities of drawing maps of various elections intances.

For the most recent version of mapel, visit its [git
repo](https://pypi.org/project/mapel/).

# Installation
For a simple installation, type:
`pip install mapel-elections`
in the console.

For more complicated variants of installation, refer to the readme of mapel
[here](https://github.com/szufix/mapel).

## Extra dependencies

For the full functionality of the package, it is recommended to also install
extra dependencies. Doing this is covered in [this
readme](https://pypi.org/project/mapel/). The extra dependencies contain:  
```
cplex>=20.1.0.1
pulp~=2.5.1
abcvoting~=2.0.0b0
permanent
```  
which unlock approval based committee rules (which require solving I(L)P
programs) and sampling a matrix using a permanent-based approach.

One can do it by invoking  
`pip install mapel-elections[extras]`

> :exclamation: Note that this library contains C++ extensions. So installing
  this library from sources  might be a bit cumbersome. We will, one day, put
  here an instruction how to do it.

## Testing Installation

If the instalation was successfull, you should be able to mimic the following:  

```
(<virtual_envirnonment_name>) $ python
...
>>> import mapel.elections.metrics.cppdistances as d
...
>>> d.swapd([[0,1,2],[0,1,2]], [[0,1,2],[2,1,0]])
3
>>> exit()
```
